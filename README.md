# Hellgate
This is a collection of code, design notes and other assets relating to my FPS 'Hellgate' for the Atari ST.

The original plan for the game was to use the shareware model and release a free demo with the first 'episode' of levels, with the option to buy the full game and get the other two. However I never got to the point of actually finishing it completely (it was close, I think) and no copies were actually ever sold!

Now, years later I thought it might be nice to at least release what I have and hopefully it will be of interest to anyone looking at what some kid, who played way too much Doom, made in their bedroom in the late 90s.
